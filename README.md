# Deep Q-Learning with Self-Play for Chess Agents

We implement a framework for deep Q-learning with self-play for chess agents using mainly pyTorch fundamentals. To implement the chess logic, such as filtering for legal moves and checking board states for checkmates, the python module [chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used.
